# QFlappyPy
@Authors: Anhad Mohananey, Yashovardhan Chaturvedi

This is an AI-based bird implementation of the game Flappy Bird in python. Qlearning algorithm has been used for reinforcement learning.

To run the game, execute the python file flap.py with command line argument specifying the frames-per-second(FPS) at which you want to run the dynamic learning algorithm.

Eg: 'python flap.py 20000' will run the game at 20,000 FPS. This implementation is done in order to speed up the learning process.
